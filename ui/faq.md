# FAQ

Here are answers to some frequently asked questions. If you don't see an answer you are looking for,
please [open a new discussion on the GitHub repo](https://github.com/structurizr/ui/discussions).

## Diagrams

### Why are the elements on my diagram sitting overlapped in the top-left corner?

You likely have manual layout enabled for the diagram, and haven't yet organised the elements on the diagram canvas.
To do this, open the diagram editor for your workspace, move the elements around, and save the workspace.

### Why aren't my diagram thumbnails appearing?

A thumbnail is automatically generated when you view the diagram via the diagram editor.
