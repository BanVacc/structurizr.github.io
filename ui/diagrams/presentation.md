# Presentation mode

The diagram viewer can has a "presentation mode", which takes your web browser into full screen mode and removes the
toolbars to leave only the diagram canvas.

When viewing a diagram, click the ![](../bootstrap-icons/easel.svg) button to enter presentation mode.

## Navigation

When in presentation mode, you can navigate to the next and previous diagrams using the `Right` and `Left` cursor keys
respectively. Many presentation clickers (e.g. those from Logitech) can be used to move to the next and previous diagrams,
by using the next/right and previous/left buttons.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Since the toolbar and buttons are not available in presentation mode,
you will need to use the keyboard shortcuts to open the diagram key, toggle tooltips, zoom in/out, step through animations, etc.

## Exiting presentation mode

To exit presentation mode, press the `Escape` key.
