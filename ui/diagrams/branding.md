# Branding

Structurizr provides the ability to apply some branding to your diagrams; including:

- Font (name and optional web font URL).
- Logo (a URL or data URI representing the image in base64 format; see [Notation - Icons](/ui/diagrams/notation#icons) for some important notes about using images).

If you're using the Structurizr DSL, these features can be specified via the [branding](/dsl/language#branding) keyword.
