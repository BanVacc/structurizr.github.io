# Structurizr DSL

The Structurizr DSL provides a way to define a software architecture model
(based upon the [C4 model](https://c4model.com)) as text, using a domain specific language (DSL).
The DSL is rendering tool independent, and to render diagrams you will need to use one of the tools listed at
[Structurizr DSL - Rendering tools](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl#rendering-tools).
