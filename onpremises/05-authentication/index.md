# Authentication

Authentication can be configured in one of three ways:

- [Form-based login, with a file-based user store](/onpremises/authentication/file)
- [Form-based login, with integration to your LDAP server](/onpremises/authentication/ldap)
- [Single sign-on with your Identity Provider via SAML 2.0](/onpremises/authentication/saml)
