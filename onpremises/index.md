# Structurizr on-premises

The Structurizr on-premises installation is a standalone version of Structurizr that can be run locally on your own infrastructure.
It's a Jakarta EE/Spring 6 web application, packaged as a `.war` file, for deployment into any compatible Jakarta EE server, such as Apache Tomcat 10.
For ease of deployment, by default, all data is stored on the local file system.
