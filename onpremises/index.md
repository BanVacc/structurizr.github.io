# Structurizr on-premises

The Structurizr on-premises installation is a standalone version of Structurizr that can be run locally on your own infrastructure.
It's a Java EE/Spring MVC web application, packaged as a `.war` file, for deployment into any compatible Java EE server, such as Apache Tomcat.
For ease of deployment, by default, all data is stored on the local file system.
Optionally, data can be stored on Amazon S3, and search indexes on an Elasticsearch cluster.
