# Quickstart

The two quickest ways to get started with the Structurizr tooling are to use the Structurizr DSL ([example](/dsl/example), [tutorial](/dsl/tutorial)) in conjunction with:

1. The [Structurizr DSL demo page](https://structurizr.com/dsl) to try the DSL and a number of diagram rendering options, without installing any tooling.
2. Structurizr Lite - a pre-built Docker image to create diagrams on your computer; see [Structurizr Lite - Quickstart](/lite/quickstart) for details.
