# Quickstart

The two quickest ways to get started with the Structurizr tooling are:

1. Use the [Structurizr DSL demo page](https://structurizr.com/dsl) to try the DSL and a number of diagram rendering options, without installing any tooling.
2. Use the DSL in conjunction with Structurizr Lite; see [Structurizr Lite - Quickstart](/lite/quickstart) for details.
